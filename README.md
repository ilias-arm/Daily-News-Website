# Daily News Website

A website with some sample articles.

There are 6 different categories (sports, politics, etc).

Some articles are open (free to read) and some are accesible only to the subscribers of the article's category.

A user can login with his username and password. He can be either author or subscriber.

If is an author, he can add articles or edit (change, delete) his own articles. There is also an option of viewing some statistics about the subscriptions, by dynamically creating an XML file and displaying the result ion the screen

If is a subscriber, he can read the articles of the category/ies that are related to his subscriptions.

In case he is a visitor, he can read the open articles or he can register to the website and optionally add some subscrptions.

All the credentials and the articles are stored in an SQL Database. 

We used PHP for the backend of the site and Javascript for making checks to the forms.

All comments are in Greek!
